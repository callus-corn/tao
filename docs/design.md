# Design of tao
This documentation explain design of tao. Using tao is out of scope.

## Motivation
This is why I'm witing a tao:

- Provisioning hardware products requires too much software. TFTP, DHCP, DNS, etc... I feel like it would be nice to have an easier way to provision hardware.
- Honestly, the biggest reason is learning.
